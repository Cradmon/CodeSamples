# CodeSamples

I present these code samples as a way of demonstrating my current version of well written code.
They focus on well known algorithms, firstly creating code that works(reliability), then refactoring to improve performance, readability and flexibility.

The goal of this project is two-fold:
* To help others improve the reasoning behind their code and
* To improve the reasoning behind my own code.

Any potential improvements to the code, or questions about any decisions are welcome. Just create an issue and we can discuss it.

P.S I don't provide the test code as it uses my own testing framework, and I acknowledge that my tests may not be as through to cover correctness of code, or as accurate to prove performance differences.
